This program was made in Python for a hackathon competition (3rd place). It calculates the probability of satellite collisions with nearby debris.


**Features**
- Real-time probability calculation for satellite-debris collision risk
- Customizable parameters for debris size, speed, and density
- Interactive GUI using Tkinter to display live data
- Utilizes threading for smooth simulation performance


**Displayed Data**
_The UI displays the following metrics in real-time:_
- Probability of Collision
- Current Altitude
- Distance of Nearest Debris
- Nearest Debris Size (Radius)
- Nearest Debris Speed
- Nearest Debris Inclination
- **Collision Chance**


**How It Works**
_The simulation calculates collision probability based on:_
- Debris altitude variation
- Debris size and velocity
- Orbital inclination
- Satellite maneuverability and shielding probability reduction
